## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the GitHub page of Crowd Computing Research Group at the university of Oulu, Finland.

We investigate collective computing, where distributed humans and algorithms address work too challenging for computers alone. Given the rapid advances in AI, we think it is imperative to identify and harness the unique aspects of human cognition and develop ways for humans and algorithms to collaborate seamlessly across different domains.
